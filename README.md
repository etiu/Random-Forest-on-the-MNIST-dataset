# Random-Forest-on-the-MNIST-dataset

In this project, I try to optimise the n_estimator hyperparameter to get the best number of n_estimators. Then I build a Random Forest model, with the best n_estimator, and I use the classification report from sklearn to check the F1, recall, precision scores. Using this method helped me identify which classes(numbers) the model struggles to identify. 

The datasets for this are contained in the zip file!
